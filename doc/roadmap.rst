Roadmap
=======

This is a list of the planned major features to be implemented in Pysic.



Version 0.5
-----------

- Implementation of the COMB potential


Version 0.6
-----------

- Implementation of the ReaxFF potential


Other planned features
----------------------

- Extensive library of potentials, including tabulated potentials
- Option for other charge relaxation algorithms
- Option for other long range interaction summation algorithms
- Convenience tools for generating parameters for Ewald summation
- Convenience tools for generating chemical symbol lists for Potentials
