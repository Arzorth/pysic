Pysic (Pythonic simulation code) documentation
==============================================

Pysic is a calculator incorporating various empirical pair and many-body
potentials in an object-based Python environment and user interface while
implementing an efficient numeric core written in Fortran. The immediate aim
of the Pysic project is to implement advanced variable-charge potentials. 

Pysic is designed to interface with the `ASE`_ simulation environment.

The code is developed as part of the `Mordred`_ project.

Pysic is in development and not suitable for production simulations yet.
